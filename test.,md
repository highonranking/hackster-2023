It seems like the issue is that the "prev" and "next" buttons in the `OrderPagination` component are not working as expected. The code you provided for the `OrderPagination` component seems correct, but there might be some issues elsewhere in your application that are affecting the pagination functionality. Let's troubleshoot this step by step:

1. **Pagination Logic**: Double-check the logic in your `Order` component where you use the `OrderPagination` component. Ensure that you're passing the correct `pagination` object and `setPagination` function as props to the `OrderPagination` component.

   In your `Order` component:
   ```jsx
   <OrderPagination
     pagination={{ total_count, total_pages, current_page, per_page }}  // Make sure these values are correctly set
     setPagination={setPagination}
   />
   ```

2. **Check Dependencies**: Verify that all the dependencies and imports related to the `OrderPagination` component are correct. Make sure you are using the appropriate versions of the `antd` library, and the `Button`, `Pagination`, `ArrowLeft`, and `ArrowRight` components are imported correctly.

3. **Check CSS/Styling**: Ensure that there are no conflicting CSS styles or positioning issues that might be preventing the buttons from being clickable.

4. **Button Click Handlers**: You could try adding some `console.log` statements inside the `itemRenderer` function of the `OrderPagination` component to see if the button clicks are being registered. For example:

   ```jsx
   const itemRenderer: PaginationProps["itemRender"] = (_, type, node) => {
     if (type === "prev") {
       console.log("Previous button clicked");
       // ... (rest of the code)
     }
     
     if (type === "next") {
       console.log("Next button clicked");
       // ... (rest of the code)
     }
   
     // ... (rest of the code)
   };
   ```

   This will help you verify if the button click events are being triggered.

5. **Console Errors**: Check the browser console for any error messages or warnings that might provide insights into what might be causing the buttons not to work.

6. **Update `useEffect` Dependencies**: In your `OrderPagination` component, you are using the `useEffect` hook. Make sure that you have provided the necessary dependencies to the `useEffect` hook to ensure it runs when needed.

By carefully reviewing and debugging these aspects, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the "prev" and "next" buttons not working in your pagination component. If the issue persists, please provide more context or specific error messages for further assistance.
